# Tektronix-CCD-Cooler
If you own a Tektronix 24xx series and you attempt a full calibration or just a repair, you have to be careful about the CCD memory section over heating!! This device will help you.
The "Cooler" is a 3D printed kit I designed. Itâ€™s made of several parts.
Two fans (120mmx120mmx25mm), are the main elements for this project. They are drived by a small switched power supply running 12V at 850mA. Fans are 120mA nominal consumption (per fan). A power cord is added to the rear for easily powered the scope under test. You can also add a speed controller at your discretion, there is room for it!
